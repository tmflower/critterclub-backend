# critterclub-backend
Provides the backend for Critter Club using Node, Express, and Postgres

I originally built this backend inside the same directory as the frontend, but had to create a new repo for it in order to deploy each separately. Unfortunately, I lost my entire commit history by doing that. Lesson learned!
😵‍💫😵🤦‍♀️ Nevertheless, it is my own original work, with the exception of the middleware functions, which I repurposed from a previous project.
